# Image Manipulator
By Vivan Prasad

> The tkinter module GUI uses .tcl files from the open-source theme "Forest Theme" by rdbende.

- One vital part of the assignment: the varying folders cannot be done with this method because of the bonus tasks of allowing for multiple things to be edited at once.

_The main.py was derived from the expample.py, so I could intuitively learn tkinter efficiently along with the aid of YouTube videos._

## How To Use the Image Manipulator

* Simply select the file you want to edit, and mess around!
* Press shift or ctrl to select multiple files, similar to that of the file explorer!
* You can open the directory via folders directly from the app!
* NOTE: _You cannot save files that have a folder included! (obviously)_
* You can also open several files at once or save multiple files with the same configured settings.

## Installation

1. Download and extract the .zip of the repository.
2. Open the "image-manipulator-main" folder in Visual Studio Code *(make sure it is not image-manipulator-main/image-manipulator-main it will not work!)*
3. Run main.py and enjoy!

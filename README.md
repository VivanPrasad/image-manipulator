# image-manipulator

The tkinter module GUI uses .tcl files from the open-source theme "Forest Theme" by rdbende.

- One vital part of the assignment, the varying folders, cannot be done with this method because of the bonus tasks of allowing for multiple things to be edited at once.

- The main.py was derived from the expample.py, so I could intuitively learn tkinter efficiently along with the aid of YouTube videos.

# How To Use the Image Manipulator

1. Simply select the file you want to edit, and mess around!
2. Press shift or ctrl to select multiple files, similar to that of the file explorer!
3. You can open the directory via folders directly from the app!
4. NOTE: You cannot save files that have a folder included (obviously)
5. You can also open several files at once or save multiple files with the same configured settings.
